//* `type` has a more succinct syntax and you only need to pull in an interface when you are trying to do declaration merging or
//* extending an existing interface or library. If you are a library author then this guidance changes to using an interface as
//* your default so that folks using your library can extend the functionality where it makes sense to them. You are not
//* able to create union, intersection, or tuple with an interface so use a `type` when creating them. The choice
//* between `type` and `interface` depends on the specific use case and requirements of your TypeScript project.
